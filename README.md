# Olympic History: Athletes and Results Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes historical Olympic Games data to uncover insights about athlete performance, medal distributions, and trends across different countries, sports, and time periods. The analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Olympic history through data exploration and visualization.

## Initial Analysis Goals

### Primary Objectives
- [x] **Medal Analysis**: Analyze medal distributions by country, sport, and time period
- [ ] **Geographic Trends**: Explore regional patterns in Olympic success
- [ ] **Temporal Analysis**: Identify trends and changes over time (1896-2016)
- [ ] **Sport-Specific Insights**: Compare performance across different sports
- [ ] **Demographics**: Analyze age, height, weight patterns of athletes

### Secondary Objectives
- [ ] **Gender Analysis**: Compare male vs female participation and performance
- [ ] **Seasonal Comparison**: Summer vs Winter Olympics patterns
- [ ] **Host Country Effects**: Analyze performance of host countries
- [ ] **Team vs Individual Sports**: Performance differences
- [ ] **Missing Data Impact**: Assess data quality and completeness

## Dataset Overview

### 1. Athlete Events Dataset (`athlete_events.csv`)
**Size**: ~271,118 records  
**Time Period**: 1896-2016  
**Columns**:
- `ID`: Unique athlete identifier
- `Name`: Athlete's full name
- `Sex`: Gender (M/F)
- `Age`: Athlete's age at time of competition
- `Height`: Height in centimeters
- `Weight`: Weight in kilograms
- `Team`: Country/team name

**Key Insights from Initial Exploration**:
- Contains data from both Summer and Winter Olympics
- Missing values in Age, Height, and Weight columns
- No duplicate records found
- Top medal-winning countries: USA (5,637), USSR (2,503), Germany (2,165)

### 2. NOC Regions Dataset (`noc_regions.csv`)
**Size**: ~231 records  
**Purpose**: Maps NOC codes to country names and regions  
**Columns**:
- `NOC`: 3-letter country code
- `region`: Full country/region name
- `notes`: Additional information (historical names, etc.)

## Data Quality Assessment

### Missing Data Analysis
- **Age**: [ ] % missing - handled by mean imputation
- **Height**: [ ] % missing - handled by mean imputation  
- **Weight**: [ ] % missing - handled by mean imputation
- **Medal**: [ ] % missing (expected for non-medalists)

### Data Cleaning Steps Completed
- [x] Removed duplicate records
- [x] Imputed missing Age, Height, Weight with mean values
- [ ] [Add any additional cleaning steps you perform]

## Analysis Plan

### Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
- [ ] **Data Overview**: Shape, data types, basic statistics

- [ ] **Distribution Analysis**: Age, height, weight distributions
- [ ] **Temporal Coverage**: Years and games represented

### Phase 2: Medal Analysis
- [ ] **Country Performance**: Total medals by country over time
- [ ] **Sport Analysis**: Medal distribution across sports
- [ ] **Top Athletes**: Most decorated athletes
- [ ] **Medal Trends**: Changes in medal distribution over time

### Phase 3: Demographic Analysis
- [ ] **Age Patterns**: Age distribution by sport, gender, medal status
- [ ] **Physical Characteristics**: Height/weight analysis by sport
- [ ] **Gender Analysis**: Participation and performance by gender
- [ ] **Geographic Demographics**: Regional athlete characteristics

### Phase 4: Advanced Analytics
- [ ] **Performance Predictors**: Factors influencing medal success
- [ ] **Host Country Effects**: Performance boost for host nations
- [ ] **Sport Specialization**: Countries' strengths in specific sports
- [ ] **Historical Trends**: Evolution of Olympic participation
